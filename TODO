== ROADMAP FOR 1.0

* [padrino-admin] Complete admin with mongomapper adapter
* [padrino-core] Code Optimizations

=== GENERAL

* Organize before/after filters that can accept :only => ... :except and work in route_eval instead of dispatch
* Template finder locale (that can look using I18n.locale ex: foo.ru.haml foo.it.haml - if present)
* Helpers for form.fields_for (one-to-one, nested and many associations like in rails)
* support for an 'annotate' function that labels the models and tests for AR, DM, and SQ about which columns they have

=== TESTING / POLISHING

* Test that controller, mailer, migration and model generators work properly

=== IDEAS

* Implement before/after filters which run on only specified routes [ before :only => [:show, "/account"] { ... } ]
* Asynchronous commands baked in (http://github.com/deadprogrammer/spork)
* Job Queue support with http://github.com/adamcooke/resque (or http://github.com/bmizerany/sinatra-dj)
* Move the mounting process (for multiple apps) to use rack-mount (http://github.com/josh/rack-mount)
* Refactor mailer to use adv_attr_accessor (for from, to, subject) methods
* Replace custom console with modified version of (http://github.com/sickill/racksh/blob/master/README.markdown)
* Tableless module which can be included to make a class into a database-less model
